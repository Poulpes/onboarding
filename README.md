# Onboarding
Here is a couple of things to do and read to get you onboard asap !

## before_action
Be sure to have a good black and white picture of yourself ! You'll use it as a profile picture for Slack, Trello, GSuite, etc.

## Coding

### Technical Setup
There is no strict technical setup imposed, you can work with your custom shortcuts and own fancy terminal as long as it's convenient for you and the rest of the team:
- to version you code with **git** and collaborate with **Github**
- to work on Ruby On Rails projets with ruby versions installed and managed by **[rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)**.
	*The ruby and rails versions will vary from project to project. You'll have to install them accordingly.*
- to work on [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package managed projects, either as a part of a larger Rails application or as a pure front end app.

Same thing apply for your editor: Sublime, Atome whatever you want as along as you're efficient with it :)

At this time *(September 2018)* everyone in the team has a configuration 100% inspired from **[Le Wagon Setup](https://github.com/lewagon/setup)** : **Do check it !**

### Poulpe Coding Conventions
There's no such thing right now ! For some projects we took time to write down some principles... for some others we didn't... some projects are brand new, some others... are not. Defining some conventions is on the agenda. Right now and generally speaking:
- for RoR we tend to agree with [these best practices](https://www.sitepoint.com/10-ruby-on-rails-best-practices-3/). (except for the *Fat Models, Skinny Controllers and Concerns* principle)
- for pure frontend app (React) we tend to like the [standard.js](https://standardjs.com/) convention
- for CSS we try to follow a component based approach and we try to take time at the start of the CSS dev to define the UIKit of the project.

At last, we're not big on linting and editor plugin and other cool stuff... so if you 're keen on rubocoping, let's share that on the upcoming projects !

### GitHub
We use GitHub to collaborate.

Right now *(Septembre 2018)*, the [Poulpe GitHub](https://github.com/Poulpes) is not an organisation account. We'll transition to an Organisation Account soon.

In the meantime, repo are created by the lead dev and access are given repo/repo by the lead dev.

On some projects, we use GitHub Wiki to write down app documentation. Generally speaking, we're trying to document our apps more and more through good PR and `.readme` files. (Check StackEdit ðŸ‘‡)

### Heroku
80% of our project are hosted on Heroku so make sure to have an account on it : either a new one with your *@poulpe.co* email or your current heroku account.

The `heroku-cli` tools come handy for working on our projects. Set up instructions are ðŸ‘‰[here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

The other 20% are either hosted on GitHub Pages, Scalingo or directly by the client.

SO, postmark, sendgrid, papertrail, amazon, cloudinary, etc. andfor desogns

### StackEdit
[StackEdit](https://stackedit.io) comes handy when to writing down your dev technical notes, preparing your PR, `.readme` files. It's free to use and you can sync files with Google Drive and GitHub.

### Other tools and services

[PostmarkApp](https://postmarkapp.com/), [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/), [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/), [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/fr), etc. are some other services, you'll come across. 

### Design

[Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/), [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)... depending on the projects, we may use different solution. 80% of the time we end up working with Sketch files.

## Project Management

### Principles
Each project is managed by a single project manager. 95% of the time, the project manager is also the lead dev of the project. (S)he is in charge of:
- dealing with the clients (requirements, explanations, more explanations, always more explanations)
- meeting the deadlines and getting everyone's concerned on time
- make sure everyone knows his/her what/why/when to do
- organising the dev among the team
- the architecture of the app an the main technical choices
- reading/commenting/merging the PR and deploying in prod
- following the time spent on the project

### Tools
Regarding tools and processes:
- Trello is our number 1 tool when managing project.
- Communication goes through Slack
- Emails are  Project Management is organiTrello is our m
